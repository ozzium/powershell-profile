# PSTuiTools

[![PSGallery Version](https://img.shields.io/powershellgallery/v/PSTuiTools.png?style=for-the-badge&label=PowerShell%20Gallery)](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSTuiTools/) [![PSGallery Downloads](https://img.shields.io/powershellgallery/dt/PSTuiTools.png?style=for-the-badge&label=Downloads)](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSTuiTools/)

This PowerShell 7 module contains a set of tools and sample scripts written using the open-source [Terminal.Gui](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui) toolkit. These types of commands are often referred to as a *tui* (terminal user interface). These commands are designed to be run in the traditional PowerShell console and should run cross-platform, where the underlying PowerShell commands, e.g. `Get-Service`, are supported.

You are welcome and encouraged to use the source code as reference material for your projects. The sample TUIs are completely functional, but should not be considered production-ready. This module is intended as a reference framework and not something to implement in production.

## Installation

You can install the module from the PowerShell Gallery:

```powershell
Install-PSResource PSTuiTools
```

The module requires a PowerShell 7. Some of the TUI examples will work cross-platform. If there is a platform restriction, you will get a warning.

> *Installation will include the required third-party assemblies.*

## Terminal.Gui

The samples in this module are built using version `1.19.0` of the open-source [Terminal.Gui](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui/tree/release/0.19). This has a dependency on the [NStack.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NStack.Core/) package. Documentation for v1 can be found at [https://gui-cs.github.io/Terminal.GuiV1Docs/](https://gui-cs.github.io/Terminal.GuiV1Docs/).

This version was selected because it is the most recent stable release, although it is also the last release in the v1 branch.

> *The file version of the Terminal.Gui.dll will show `1.0.0.0` but the product version is `1.19.0`.*

### Terminal.Gui v2

Version 2 of Terminal.Gui is currently in development. The core features are supposedly set, but the current release is only at the alpha stage. I am hesitant to create TUI samples that might break with new pre-releases. There are significant changes in v2. When it is officially released, the plan is to update this module to use the latest stable version.

If you want to create TUIs using version 2, you can find reference documentation at [https://gui-cs.github.io/Terminal.Gui/](https://gui-cs.github.io/Terminal.Gui/). One feature I am looking forward to is removing the NStack dependency.

### Potential Assembly Conflicts

There are other PowerShell modules you might have installed that also use Terminal.Gui. A prime example is the Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools which provides the `Out-ConsoleGridView` command. This project uses v1.16.0 of the Terminal.Gui assembly. If this module is loaded first, you'll get a warning about the version conflict. I can't guarantee that all TUIs in this module will work as expected. If you load this module first, and then try to load Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools, you'll get an error about the version conflict and the `Out-ConsoleGridView` command will not work.

Your best course of action is to choose one module or the other in your PowerShell session. This might require you to restart your PowerShell session.

This [module](PSTuiTools.psm1) includes code to attempt to mitigate assembly conflicts. I am open to PRs that provide a better solution.

## PSTuiTools

The module contains the following commands and features. The TUIs are __primarily intended__ as examples and reference material for you to use in your own projects. All commands include full help.

### [Invoke-PSTuiTools](docs\Invoke-PSTuiTools.md)

As an alternative to `Get-PSTuiTools`, you can run `Invoke-PSTuiTools` to see the available commands in a TUI. You can select a command to run it and see the help description.

![Invoke-PSTuiTools](images/invoke-pstuitools.png)

### [Invoke-HelloWorld](docs\Invoke-Helloworld.md)

Every project like this needs a *Hello World* example. This is a simple TUI that displays a label and a button. When the button is clicked, the label text will change. It will revert to the original text after 5 seconds.

![Hello World](images/hello-world.png)

This TUI has a PowerSell alias of `HelloWorld`.

### [Get-TuiCredential](docs\Get-TuiCredential.md)

This TUI will present a form to the user to enter a username and password. When the user clicks the submit button, a PSCredential object will be returned.

```powershell
$cred = Get-TuiCredential
```

![Get-TuiCredential](images/tui-credential.png)

You can pass a user name as a parameter value from the PowerShell prompt.

This command has an alias of `tuicred`.

### [Invoke-ProcessPeeker](docs\Invoke-ProcessPeeker.md)

This is a sample TUI to display process information and details. Select a process from the list on the left to see details in the panel on the right.

![Process Peeker](images/processpeeker.png)

### [Invoke-ServiceInfo](docs\Invoke-ServiceInfo.md)

This TUI will display service information from the specified computer. You can use alternate credentials to connect. You can also filter the services by status.

![Service Info](images/serviceinfo.png)

### [Invoke-SystemStatus](docs\Invoke-SystemStatus.md)

This is a very complex TUI that displays a variety of system information derived from `Get-CimInstance`.

![System Status](images/systemstatus.png)

This command has an alias of `TuiStatus` You can specify a computer and alternate credentials from the prompt.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-Command Invoke-SystemStatus -Syntax

Invoke-SystemStatus [[-Computername] <string>] [-Credential <pscredential>] [-WindowColor <Color>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

Or enter new credentials if you want to change the computer.

The TUI includes an optional automatic refresh feature. You should set the refresh value (in seconds) first, then click the `Start Timer` button. If you use a timer and want to change the computer, you should stop the timer first, then change the computer and start the timer again.

You can always refresh the information manually by clicking the `Refresh` button.

### [Invoke-TuiMp3](docs\Invoke-TuiMp3.md)

This function will launch a simple TUI-based audio player. You can specify the path to a `.mp3` or `.m4a` file to play, or open a file from the menu. You can set a default library folder to open to simplify navigation. Use the buttons to control playback. Selected metadata and lyrics will be displayed if found in the MP3 file.

![MP3 Player](images/tuimp3-player.png)

You can control the volume by clicking the volume bar, the +/- buttons, or using Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down.

Beginning with v0.5.0, the player will keep a most recently played list. As new songs are played, they will be added to the list. The maximum number of entries is 10. After that, the oldest entry is removed. The list is persisted in a file called `tuiMp3-most-recent.txt` under `$HOME`. If you uninstall the module, you will need to manually remove the file.

Version 0.6.0 and later of the module allow you to set the TUI foreground and background colors. Use tab-completion to see the possible color values.

Note that there is a limitation in the file dialog. You cannot load a file if it has a comma in the name because it gets processed as an array. This is a limitation in Terminal.Gui. However, you can specify a file with commas in the name with the `FilePath` parameter when launching the TUI Mp3 player.

This function uses the TagLibSharp library to read audio media metadata.

### [Invoke-TuiColorDemo](docs\Invoke-TuiColorDemo.md)

You can use this TUI to experiment with different color combinations. The TUI will dynamically update sample code which you should be able to copy and paste into your project.

![Tui Color Demo](images/colordemo.png)

### [Invoke-TuiTreeDemo](docs\Invoke-TuiTreeDemo.md)

This command will run a sample TUI that uses the TreeView control. It will display a specified path as a tree showing files and folders. You can control the depth. The default is 4. The more levels, the longer it will take to open the TUI, especially for large folders.

Default path is $HOME, but you can specify a folder.

![tuiTreeDemo](images/tuitree-demo.png)

You can manually click in the tree to expand and collapse nodes or use the toggle button. Details from the selected tree item will be displayed in another detail tree on the right. You might see different detail information depending on the file.

If you right click a file in the main tree, depending on the file extension, the contents will be displayed in a dialog box. Most text files should be displayed.

Enter a new path in the text field and click the Update button to show a new tree. This will use the existing depth value.

### [Invoke-TuiGraph](docs\Invoke-TuiGraph.md)

This command will launch a demonstration TUI that uses the graphing feature to display a hypothetical bar chart showing usage percentages from a variety of file extensions.

![Tui Graph](images/tui-graph.png)

### [Invoke-TuiTemplate](docs\Invoke-TuiTemplate.md)

While you can manually open any file in this repository in your editor, I wanted to give you an easy way to jump start your TUI project. This command will open a demonstration TUI with a sample button. You can view the source code, or use the Copy button to copy the code to the clipboard. You can then paste the code into your project and modify it as needed.

![Tui Template](images/tui-template.png)

### [Save-TuiAssembly](docs\Save-TuiAssembly.md)

Finally, you will need to include the Terminal.Gui and NStack assemblies in your project. You could copy the assembly files in this module, or run `Save-TuiAssembly` to download the latest versions of these assemblies to a local folder. You can then reference the assemblies in your project.

```powershell
Save-TuiAssembly -DestinationPath "C:\Tools\"
```

This will save both `Terminal.Gui.dll` and `NStack.Core.dll` to the specified folder. Your project will need to load the assemblies before you can use the Terminal.Gui namespace.

```powershell
Add-Type -path <path>\Nstack.dll
Add-Type -path <path>\Terminal.Gui.dll
```

Depending on your project, you may have other ways to load the assemblies.

## TUI Design

The TUIs were designed using Windows Terminal on Windows 11 running a 120x35 windows size. Layout might vary on non-Windows systems.

The module examples are not intended to be feature complete tools. They are written as proof-of-concepts and models for your own work. You are welcome to enhance any of the samples. For example, the MP3 player TUI could be enhanced to include a playlist, volume controls, or playback history.

As you look through the code, you'll see that I am not consistent in how I write PowerShell to create the TUI. Some scripts use the `Terminal.Gui` namespace and others reference classes directly. You may also see code like this to define a TUI element:

```powershell
$lblUsername = [Terminal.Gui.Label] @{
    Text = 'UserName'
    X    = 1
    Y    = 1
}
```

Or like this:

```powershell
$lblUsername = [Terminal.Gui.Label]::new()
$lblUsername.Text = 'UserName'
$lblUsername.X = 1
$lblUsername.Y = 1
```

You can also use `New-Object`:

```powershell
$lblUsername = New-Object Terminal.Gui.Label
```

Although I don't think I am using this technique in my samples. I wanted to demonstrate different techniques, any of which are acceptable. Find one that makes the most sense to you and use it consistently in your code.

> *I have no pretensions that I am an expert in creating TUIs with Terminal.Gui. There is no guarantee that my code samples are the only way, or even the best way, to accomplish a given task. I'm hoping that we can use the Discussions section of this repository to share ideas and learn from each other.*

And one final word on color: How Terminal.Gui renders a color like `Green` will depend on the terminal's color scheme and possibly the operating system.

## Notes

If you encounter a persistent bug with a TUI, you can file an Issue. Otherwise, feel free to use the Discussion section of this repository to ask questions or share your own TUI projects.
